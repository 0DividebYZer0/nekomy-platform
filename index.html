			<p><strong>Hypatia is a FREE, Open Source LMS (Learning Management System) focussed in UX and remote coworking. You can use it to build your online school, academy or university.</strong></p>
		
			<p>The target of this project is to build an open source, real-time Learning Management System for the web based on the powerful and popular Facebook's React framework and Google’s Firebase cloud platform.</p>
			<p>Hypatia aims at solving the issues that current LMSs have, like bad and slow UX, old and cluttered designs and unresponsive layouts. The way these issues will be solved is by using the most advanced web technologies, like the shadow DOM for fast rendering, web sockets for real-time communication, JSON for standardised and formatted data, integration with 3rd party APIs and the latest HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript features to build a functional and beautiful UI following the best practices.</p>
			<p>Hypatia is designed with universities and academies in mind. There's no size limit. It can be used for small academies (5 - 100 students) and for big universities (1K - 100K). The system will be scalable, allowing modules to be enabled/disabled based on the requirements of the organisation.</p>
			<p>The project will be monetised by offering a freemium scheme. The premium version will include a maintenance fee to implement upgrades and custom/premium plugins.</p>
			<p>The ultimate target of this project is to offer a solution to the open source community that feels as the Wordpress of the LMS world. Flexible enough to suit the needs of the majority of educational projects by being scalable, easy to use/learn and opened to be used, modified and improved.</p>
			<p>Hopefully, Hypatia will enable people around the world to make education more accessible and enjoyable, especially for those who live in developing countries.</p>
			
			<h3><a id="who-can-use-it" class="anchor" href="#who-can-use-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Context and project justification</h3>

			<p>The reason why I chose to build a Learning Management System is because I keep seeing how things could be done better in many e-learning related websites. I particularly have a lot of things to say regarding the way students interact with each other and with the teacher. The current systems do not provide an agile communication. The interactive experience feels slow, with server related errors appearing often, annoying popup windows, cluttered UI with non-relevant data...</p>

			<p>This problem is highly relevant, as online education is becoming more and more popular, especially in developed countries, where society is used to interact with computers in a daily basis. Not having an updated and well taken care of e-learning ecosystem, makes people’s lives more difficult, as they have to balance a highly productive job and personal environments with slow and unpleasant online learning experiences.</p>

			<p>Having e-learning websites that don’t keep up with the rest of the web evolutions, makes the educational experience less enjoyable, which, in some cases, can make students give up their courses or entrepreneurs fail with their ventures.</p>

			<p>To fix this situation, we need to improve the offer out there. Make the e-learning software community vibrant and competitive. That’s the reason I want to build a platform inspired on successful and modern real-time products, like Slack, Trello or Google Docs and integrate them in a rich, full-flavored and exciting e-learning platform.</p>

			<p>There are other LMS already in the market with APIs and modern stacks, like Moodle (23% of market share), Canvas LMS, Blackboard (41% of market share), Matrix, D2L, Kaanu, etc. Unfortunately, they don’t offer good UX or they don’t make it easy for individuals to gain access to their software and/or modify it to offer a more customised experience for their students.</p>

			<h3><a id="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The most important goal is to offer a full-stack application to the open source community that enables developers and entrepreneurs to create their own e-learning sites</li>

				<li>The back-end will be driven by Google’s Firebase platform, which will simplify the infrastructure maintenance and scalability, making it easy for developers to start and deploy their apps</li>

				<li>The front-end will be initially built using Facebook’s React framework, although in a future, it can be ported to React Native to take advantage of the native Android and iOS features</li>

				<li>The second most important goal is to create a very polished UX by creating a well curated information architecture, easy to follow journeys and have as many user testing revisions as possible</li>

				<li>The simplicity of the navigation and the prioritisation of content is key. Only the most relevant content for a given section will be displayed. This will ensure that the UI remains uncluttered</li>

				<li>The application will implement as many real time features as possible, allowing users to be notified and to communicate with other users in an agile manner. No more old style forums, emails or other slow and cluttered systems to talk to each other or get updates from the system</li>

				<li>Include multi-language support, social user authentication and analytics</li>

				<li>Allow users to create themes for the UI. This will help other users with less web development experience to take advantage of the community to improve the look & feel of their e-learning sites</li>

				<li>Implement a basic admin area to allow teachers/admins edit the courses/subjects’ contents, calendars, users, payments, etc</li>

				<li>The essential journey should allow a user to signup/login, read about the available courses/subjects, join a course/subject (with or without paying), read/download the resources, interact with the classmates and teacher, read/download the assignments and watch the calendar</li>

				<li>Phase II: create a set of templates and guidelines to allow developers create plugins to enhance the functionality of the platform. These plugins could be new features, like the ability to solve quizzes or integrations of 3rd party services like Paypal, Stripe, Google Docs, Flickr, Dropbox, Slack, Trello, etc</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3><a id="method-and-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#method-and-philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method and philosophy followed</h3>
			
			<p>The only possible strategy to accomplish the objectives, is to start a new project from scratch. It wouldn’t be possible to match the UX, design and real-time expectations by using an existing product.</p>

			<p>Nonetheless, we don’t need to create every single unit of information or configure and maintain an infrastructure module by module. One of the most important mantras in computer science is to “not reinvent the wheel” and by that, we mean that it’s a good practice to take advantage of platforms, libraries, frameworks, boilerplates and other systems that have a high level of consistency and/or support to speed up our development time and increase the quality and potential success of our project.</p>

			<p>In any case, we have to make sure that the 3rd party tools or systems that we use, are all very well supported and the people behind their maintenance have a high level and long term commitment with them.</p>

			<p>Some years ago, I learned a lesson from my mentor that it is still very relevant in the always-evolving world wide web: “we have to use the Internet as a CMS”. This line resonated with me for a long time, as it is a statement that takes some courage to follow. It enforces you to trust people and organisations with critical features of your application.</p>

			<p>The initial thoughts when choosing the technology stack for a project are always about being cautious and how those decisions could impact the life of the product. Sometimes it’s a gamble, we never know if a company is going to close or be bought by another one. The recent history has shown us that things like this happen, like what Steve Jobs did to Flash...</p>

			<p>The lesson therefore is to choose wisely and try to follow the standards, like the ones from the W3C, as they tend to be the most reliable and stable reference. In the second level of this imaginary scale of trust would be big companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, etc. Even if they are still at risk of terminating products and services, they tend to give a lot of support when that happens.</p>

			<p>What we should try to avoid (when building a professional product) is to rely on libraries/tools/frameworks with very few people behind them or not committed enough. This is a risky situation, as they might leave the project anytime without notice, leaving us stuck and having to invest precious development time refactoring the app.</p>

			<p>After this quick introduction about tech stack decision making, I would like to explain my approach for Hypatia.</p>

			<p>In the production of this project, there are four main different areas that require attention: design, UX, front-end and back-end. There are also other aspects to take care of, like planning, documentation, QA, user testing, deployment and infrastructure.</p>

			<p>The approach for the first two main areas, design and UX, consists on researching about several e-learning platforms already in production, like the UOC website, the Moodle LMS, Canvas and Blackboard.</p>

			<p>I also want to analyse some real-time tools like Slack or Trello and websites like, RentalCars.com or Booking.com, to find out more about how they implemented this real-time feel to their UI.</p>

			<p>Once I have enough information about the basic content needed to create a full learning journey, I will create a basic information architecture, which will consist on a sitemap and a set of wireframes for the different view templates.</p>

			<p>Finally, in terms of UX and design, there’s an important decision I will have to make at some point regarding editing content. One option is to allow users to edit the content inline and the other option is to create a basic admin area where they can edit the content.</p>

			<p>At the same time, when the initial research is done, I will also create some UML diagrams to map the architecture and the database structure. This will help to clarify and confirm the tech stack initially selected. </p>

			<p>If none of the above changes the initial plan, the front-end will be architected using Facebook’s React framework and the Redux pattern. Of course, the stack consists of other libraries, but these two are the most representative.</p>

			<p>Regarding the backend, initially I thought about using a Node.js, Express and MongoDB stack, but after learning about Google’s Firebase, I feel that this could help to simplify a project that is already quite ambitious in terms of complexity and size. At the same time, I think Firebase would also help other developers to manage a stack that otherwise might be too big for the kind of small teams this project is aimed to.</p>

			<p>In the last weeks, I have been researching about react boilerplates, especially the ones targeting start-ups. This is a very common resource to speed-up the setup of an MVP, which it’s precisely what we need to do with Hypatia.</p>

			<p>In the following website, there’s a list of the most popular React boilerplates around the world at this moment. Once I analysed the ones in the top of the list, I came to the conclusion that ‘Este’ was the most appropriate one, as it supports most of the objectives, including Firebase.</p>

			<p>Nonetheless, after evaluating the high complexity of Este, I have realised that it would take me a long time to learn the author’s approach. For that reason, I decided to build my own boilerplate based on my previous experience with other React projects.</p>

			<p>There are also other boilerplates with very interesting stacks, including GraphQL and a deeper isomorphic/universal integration, but these might increase the complexity of the stack and therefore of the project.</p>

			<p>Regarding the BaaS offered by Firebase, there’s not much research required, as they have a fantastic documentation with many code examples and a really easy to use API. One of the aspects that needs a bit of research is regarding the integration of Firebase with Redux and React, as we need a seamless approach to load and save data.</p>

			<p>After some time researching, I have found a library that will be a perfect fit. The developers behind it seem to be committed with the project and reply quickly on any inquire.</p>

			<p>Hypatia was born as a university graduation project in September 2016. Planning, design and development took place during the following months until April 2017, when the alpha version is expected. A few months after that, I should have a beta version ready and perhaps around mind 2017 we could have a RC version. Stay tuned!</p>

			<p>The initial part of the project (until the alpha version) is closed for contributions, as it's a university personal project that needs to be developed individually and then reviewed by the university board. After that, the project will be opened to contributions. If you have any question please contact me at hello {@} theon {.} io</p>
